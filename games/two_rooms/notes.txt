TODOS:
test exchange hostages
let leader abdicate
vote on leaders
use the bot to reveal instead of ppl just talking
add more roles
figure out how to handle private reveal like agent

TwoRoomsGame
- handles messages from discord
- move game state to a separate class that side effects of messages?

where does seomthing like rooms, tracking which players have interacted, adn the logic of players sharing cards go?


what will a role need to have?

readable name
readable directions
card color
id*
whether it allows for a buried card
an expression describing when that role wins
list of conditions card may:
    shy, immune, ambassador(?), blind(?should we even include this?), dead, coy, foolish, in love/hate with $player
    liar/truther(not that bot can enforce)


*can be generated at runtime?


chanel message for role share req would be like
@sendee @sender has requested to share role do you want to accept?
@sendee click checkmark to accept @sender click x to cancel

on_reaction_add index into a message dict with the message id the reaction was added to
if it's in our request dict and the adder clicked an appropriate box and we are in a state where that action is valid
affect that change.
remove all reactions to that message as soon as somebody clicks one of them and remove that message from the queue


if the player has some modifier such as shy or leprechaun that affects this interaction still send the message as normal
